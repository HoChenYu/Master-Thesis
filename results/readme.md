This directory contains the Python scripts that process data and generate plots for the thesis "Heterogeneous Resource Allocation Algorithms for Containers with DRAM and Persistent Memory". Each Python script reads an Excel file with specific data, performs computations, and outputs a PNG plot file. Below are the details for each script and their I/O operations.

## üìù Scripts Overview

### `fig0.py`
- **Input**: `fig0.xlsx` (Excel file)
  - The Excel file contains data related to the DRAM size, ranging from 4GB to 256GB.
- **Output**: `fig0.png`
  - A plot showing the results for varying DRAM sizes.
